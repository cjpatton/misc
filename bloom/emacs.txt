Emacs commands:
C = <Ctrl>
M = <Alt) (right-alt is better) 

C-x C-c        ... exit emacs
C-a            ... go to beginning of line
C-k            ... kill to end of line
C-x C-s        ... save current buffer 
C-x C-f        ... open new or existing file
M-x compile    ... run make 
M-x linum-mode ... turn on line numbers 
C-x x          ... kill current buffer 
C-x u          ... undo  

To make emacs display line number FOREVER, add the following to ~/.emacs:
(global-linum-mode t)

C-space        ... set beginning of selected region. Use arrows to select. 
                   Hitting it again will toggle it. 
C-w            ... cut region 
M-w            ... copy region 
C-y            ... paste region

M-! acpi       ... check battery life
